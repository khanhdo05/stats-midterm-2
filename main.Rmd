Our study is restricted to only those women who were at least 18 years old and younger than 41 (that is 40 and 11 months is fine, 41 years and 0 months is not) at the time of delivery.

# Finn:
# Attempting to use lubridate to filter only patients from are 18 years old and younger than 41.

# Once we have the birth claims, we can join with members to filter out any

# Group by id for a single patient.

# We may be able to remove patients who do not fit any of our criteria.
# However... this is a limited analysis, does not consider timeframe.
# Might be good for chopping down observations.

# Idea: remove individuals of disinterest from patient_summaries, and then join
# by matching patient IDs which remain.
