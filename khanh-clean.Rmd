# Read Data

```{r}
# Membership file
member <- read.csv("https://collinn.github.io/data/member.csv") %>%
  mutate(DoB = ymd(DoB))  # convert DoB early

# Claims file
claims <- read.csv("https://collinn.github.io/data/claims.csv")
```

Our study is restricted to only those women who were at least 18 years old and younger than 41 at the time of delivery.
